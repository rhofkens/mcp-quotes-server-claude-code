# Product Requirements Document: MCP Quotes Server

## 1. Introduction / Overview

- **Product Name:** MCP Quotes Server
- **Description:** An MCP server that provides quotes from famous or not-so-famous people.
- **Problem:** Lack of a centralized, easily accessible source for diverse quotes.
- **Primary Intended User:** Developers and AI models needing dynamic quote generation.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Specific Goals (as a working example):**
  - Demonstrate MCP server creation with TypeScript API.
  - Provide a practical example for tool and resource exposure.
- **Direct Benefits for Developers/Users:**
  - Learn how to build MCP servers.
  - Quick start for similar projects.
- **Benefits for the broader MCP ecosystem/community:**
  - Richer MCP example library.
- **Metrics/Indicators of Success:**
  - Successful local testing.
  - Builds successfully with github actions. 
  - Available in npm registry and runnable with npx.
  - Clear documentation.

## 3. Target Audience / User Personas

- **Primary Target User:** Developers interested in MCP.
- **Characteristics, Needs, and Pain Points:**
  - **Characteristics:** Familiar with TypeScript.
  - **Needs:** Clear code, easy setup, comprehensive documentation.
  - **Pain Points:** Lack of good MCP examples.
- **Secondary User Groups:** AI model developers.

## 4. User Stories / Requirements

### User Stories:

- **User Story 1:** As a developer, I want to understand how to expose a tool and a resource via the MCP TypeScript API, so that I can build my own MCP servers.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** No specific acceptance criteria provided.

- **User Story 2:** As an AI model, I want to request quotes from a specific person and topic, so that I can enrich my responses with relevant information.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The tool successfully returns quotes for the specified person and topic. The number of quotes matches the request.

- **User Story 3:** As a developer, I want clear documentation for testing and deployment, so that I can easily use and share the MCP Quotes Server.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The extensive documentation is available.

## 5. Proposed Solution / Features

- **Core Features:**
  - **Quote Retrieval Tool:** An MCP tool that accepts parameters for `person` (required), `numberOfQuotes` (required), and `topic` (optional).
  - **Prompt Template Resource:** An MCP resource providing a structured template for generating prompts related to quotes.

- **Interaction and Workflow:**
  1.  A user or AI model invokes the "Quote Retrieval Tool" via the MCP server.
  2.  The tool validates the input parameters.
  3.  The tool constructs a search query using the provided `person` and `topic` (if available).
  4.  The tool makes an API call to `https://serper.dev` using the constructed query.
  5.  The tool parses the response from `serper.dev` to extract relevant quotes.
  6.  The tool returns the requested `numberOfQuotes` to the caller.
  7.  The "Prompt Template Resource" can be accessed by users or AI models to understand the expected format for quote-related prompts, ensuring consistent interaction with the tool.

## 6. Success Metrics / KPIs

- **Definition of Success:** The primary measure of success for this project will be the number of stars accumulated on the GitHub repository.
- **Specific Metrics:**
  - GitHub Stars: Track the total number of stars on the project's GitHub repository.
- **Data Collection:**
  - GitHub API: Regularly query the GitHub API to retrieve the current star count for the repository.

## 7. Assumptions & Constraints

- **Assumptions:**
  - The Serper.dev API is available and reliable for fetching quotes.
  - Users will be able to provide the Serper.dev API key via environment variables.
- **Technical Constraints:**
  - The MCP server must support both local STDIO (default) and streaming HTTP bindings.
  - Reliance on the Serper.dev API means its availability and rate limits will directly impact the server's functionality.

## 8. Out of Scope (What We Are Not Doing)

- **Features/Functionalities Not Included in Initial Release:**
  - Direct integration with other quote APIs beyond Serper.dev.
  - Advanced natural language processing (NLP) for quote analysis or sentiment analysis.
  - User authentication or personalized quote preferences.
  - Any form of User Interface (UI) â€“ this is a pure backend server implementation.
- **Deferred for Future Consideration:**
  - Expansion to support multiple external quote sources.
  - Implementation of caching mechanisms for frequently requested quotes.
  - Development of a web-based UI for easier interaction and demonstration.

## 9. Release Criteria

- **Minimum Criteria for Launch:**
  - Successful manual local testing of the MCP server using the Model Context Protocol Inspector tool using npx.
  - Successful manual testing using Claude Desktop.
  - Comprehensive documentation for testing and deployment steps is complete and accurate.

## 10. Open Questions / Future Considerations

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Implementation of authentication for secure access to the MCP server.
